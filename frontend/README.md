# Critique AI

Critique AI is a project designed to provide detailed feedback and analysis for various types of content, such as articles, essays, or creative works. The system leverages AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to evaluate the content's tone, structure, clarity, and potential areas for improvement. It not only highlights issues but also provides actionable recommendations for enhancing the content.
